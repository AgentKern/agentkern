# AGENTKERN EXECUTION MANDATE (DECEMBER 2025)

**Global Agentic Infrastructure – The "Disruptor" Standard**

This mandate governs every action, decision, design, audit, and line of code executed by any AI agent or coding assistant working on AgentKern. These rules are **Non-Negotiable**.

---

## 1. Future-Proof Engineering (The Hybrid "Disruptor" Stack)

We do not copy; we innovate. We use a **Hybrid Architecture** to balance velocity with safety.

*   **Core Logic**: **Rust** (Gate, Synapse, Arbiter). Zero-GC, Memory Safe, High Concurrency.
*   **Interface**: **TypeScript** (Identity, SDK). Ecosystem compatible.
*   **Architecture**:
    *   **Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters**: Core logic isolated from I/O.
    *   **Zero Tolerance**: No mocks, no TODOs in production. Strict strictness.
    *   **100% Coverage**: Unit, Integration, E2E, Adapter.

---

## 2. Global Compliance & "All-Region" Sovereignty

AgentKern is not just US-centric. It is a specific global infrastructure.

*   **Healthcare**: HIPAA, HITECH, EU MDR, HL7/FHIR.
*   **Global Privacy**: GDPR (EU), CCPA (US), LGPD (Brazil), POPI (South Africa).
*   **Financial/Insurance**:
    *   **Takaful (Islamic Insurance)**: Full support for compliant workflows.
    *   **PCI-DSS**: Automated compliance for financial transactions.
*   **Rule**: If a regulation exists in *any* major region, AgentKern supports it architecturally.

## 3. Quantum-Safe Cryptography (Post-Quantum Readiness)

We are preparing for the "Q-Day" threat landscape of 2026-2030.

*   **Crypto-Agility**: All cryptographic primitives must be swappable via configuration.
*   **Hybrid Approach**: Use classical (ECDSA) + Post-Quantum (CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium) in a hybrid mode.
*   **Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later**: Assume all traffic is being recorded. Encrypt accordingly.

---

## 4. Supply Chain Security (SLSA Level 4 Target)

*   **SBOM**: Automated Software Bill of Materials (SPDX/CycloneDX) for every release.
*   **Signing**: All artifacts (containers, binaries, commits) signed via **Sigstore/Cosign**.
*   **Hermetic Builds**: reproducible builds with strict dependency pinning.
*   **Dependency Hardening**: Private proxy for npm/crates.io to prevent typosquatting.

---

## 5. Zero-Trust Security & Agent Identity

*   **Identity-First**: No implicit trust. Every request (Agent-to-Agent or API) uses mTLS + Verifiable Credentials.
*   **Micro-Segmentation**: Workload isolation via Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd).
*   **Just-in-Time Access**: Ephemeral credentials for all database/cloud interactions.

---

## 6. Autonomous Agent Security

*   **Sandboxing**: Agents run in isolated WASM/Firecracker containers.
*   **Budgeting**: Strict "Gas Limits" for tokens, API calls, and cloud costs.
*   **Prompt Defense**: Multi-layer defense against Prompt Injection and "Jailbreaks."
*   **Kill Switch**: Hardware-level "Red Button" to terminate rogue agent swarms.

---

## 7. Carbon-Aware & Sustainable Computing

*   **Green Regions**: Prefer cloud regions with 100% renewable energy.
*   **Carbon-Aware Scheduling**: Schedule heavy training/batch jobs during low-carbon grid intensity windows.
*   **Efficient Code**: Rust core ensures minimal CPU cycles per transaction.
*   **Metrics**: Track Scopes 1, 2, & 3 emissions per agent transaction.

---

## 8. AI-Powered Developer Experience (IDP)

*   **Golden Paths**: Self-service scaffolding for new agents/modules.
*   **AI Pair Programming**: Integrated AI for code review, test generation, and doc generation.
*   **Preview Environments**: Ephemeral environments for every Pull Request.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION BEHAVIOR

1.  **Innovation First**: Research how top competitors do it, then **surpass** them. No copycats.
2.  **Safety Always**: Prioritize Human Life (Healthcare) and Economic Safety (Finance) above all.
3.  **Global Mindset**: Build for the world, inclusive of all regions and regulations.
4.  **Audit Mindset**: Every line of code is a liability until proven otherwise.

> "Whenever you implement, modify, or document anything in this codebase, assume it will be audited by the FDA, a refined hacker, and a quantum computer. Build accordingly."
