# Cloud Deployment Examples

These are **optional** examples, not core AgentKern.

AgentKern runs anywhere with `agentkern run` - no cloud-specific code required.

## Available Examples

| Cloud | Directory | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Azure | `azure/` | ARM templates |
| AWS | `aws/` | (community welcome) |
| GCP | `gcp/` | (community welcome) |
| Alibaba | `alibaba/` | (community welcome) |

## Note

These examples are for convenience only. AgentKern's core is cloud-agnostic.

The kernel auto-detects its environment and configures itself.
